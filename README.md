# Virtual Dashboard

This is a _Virtual Car Dashboard_ with real-time speed-o-meter which takes the input from **GET** Request and real-time renders to the mentioned speed in the **GET** Request.

This project made as the _Task-1_ for applying for an internship at **ThingsGoSocial**.

---

## How It Works

1. Open **_index.html_** on one tab after cloning the project.
2. Open the **_[API Reference](https://speedometer-jagnani73-11052020.herokuapp.com/setSpeed?speed=173)_** on a new tab.
3. On the URL mentioned on Step 2, change the **speed** query parameter to any number that you would like to see as the _current speed_.
4. This will send the _speed_ of your choice via the **GET** request
5. Sit back, relax and enjoy the transition.
